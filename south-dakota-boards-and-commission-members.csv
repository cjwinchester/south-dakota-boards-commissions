The American farmer is good at what we do, which means most Americans don’t need to worry about where their food comes from. Because the SDSRPC board is made up of farmers, we have first-hand knowledge of the work that goes into raising our quality product and can help get our story out.”",https://www.sdsoybean.org/contact-us/the-south-dakota-soybean-staff/,605-330-9942,sdsrpc@sdsoybean.org,https://danr.sd.gov/
